## Code of Conduct

Before contributing to the project, please read and adhere to the [**Code of Conduct**](CODE_OF_CONDUCT_zh-CN.md).

## Basic Requirements
Before contributing, ensure that you develop using Unity 2021.3.15f1 LTS (International Edition).

Make sure all your changes aim to solve issues within the project itself and are not fixes for limitations or problems in the build environment, IDE, or other external tools.

Please use **Rider** for coding whenever possible to adhere to the project's code format and style, maintaining consistency throughout the codebase.

Before submitting changes, ensure that your modifications have undergone thorough testing.

Contributions should be made to the **Develop** branch, not the **Main** branch.

### Reporting Bugs

Before reporting a bug, please browse the [Issue list](https://github.com/motion-canvas/motion-canvas/issues). There might already be a discussion related to your issue.

If such a discussion exists, avoid submitting a duplicate Issue; instead, share your perspective in the existing discussion.

If no relevant discussion is found, feel free to submit a new Issue. Name it "Bug: xxx" and await review.

After review, the Issue will be marked with the **c-accepted** label, indicating that it has been accepted.

### Proposing Changes

If you intend to make changes to the project, first [create an Issue](https://github.com/Bli-AIk/Undertale-Changer-Template/issues) and name it "Feat: xxx". Then await review.

We will discuss your proposal in the corresponding Issue. If your plan is feasible, the Issue will be marked with the **c-accepted** label, and you can proceed with implementation.

For small fixes like typo corrections or bug fixes, you can directly submit a Pull Request. However, please include a clear and concise description of the fix.

### Accepted Issues

Before working on an Issue, ensure it is labeled **c-accepted** and has not already been claimed by someone else to avoid duplicated efforts.

Once you start working, leave a comment in the Issue to notify others.

If someone has claimed an Issue but hasn't made progress within two weeks, you may take over. In this case, leave a comment explaining the situation to keep everyone informed.

### Submitting a Pull Request

1. Fork this repository, ensuring it contains the **develop** branch.

2. Create a new branch in your forked repository for your changes.

3. Update the code.

4. Commit your changes with descriptive messages.

5. Push the branch to GitHub.

6. Submit a Pull Request to the main repository's **develop** branch and **request a review**.
