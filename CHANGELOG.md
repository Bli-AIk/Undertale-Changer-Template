## v1.0.2 - Foreword

First of all, I made a big mistake—since UCT updated to v1.0.2, there have been numerous updates, but its version number has remained at v1.0.2. This is the result of long-term neglect of the update log.

In fact, initially updating UCT to version 1.0.0 was a mistake in some sense—I thought my template was completed, but it now seems far from it. Nevertheless, changing the version number back would be more troublesome. So for now, let it be.

In the last update of v1.0.2, I created this file—**CHANGELOG.md**—as a record of every update's contents and the plans for the next update.

The version number updates will follow these rules:

1. When a **PATCH** update occurs (1.0.X, where **X** is changed), it usually means this update involves bug fixes or modifications/refactoring of existing functionalities, without adding new features or content.
2. When a **MINOR** update occurs (1.X.0, where **X** is changed), it typically means this update adds new features or content.
3. When a **MAJOR** update occurs (X.0.0, where **X** is changed), it usually implies... <small>*Alright, I guess MAJOR will never change.*</small>
4. Before moving to the next version, the version number will have a suffix -part X. X represents the number of completed tasks.

The format for updates is as follows:

#### vX.X.0 -> vX.X.1 Summary of Updates

- [x] Task 1 (Completed)
- [x] Task 2 (Completed)

XX Year/XX Month/XX Day Plan

XX Year/XX Month/XX Day Completed

#### vX.X.1 -> vX.X.2 Summary of Updates

- [ ] Task 1 (Not Completed)
- [ ] Task 2 (Not Completed)

XX Year/XX Month/XX Day Plan (x-x items)

XX Year/XX Month/XX Day Completed

The completion time refers to the time when the last item was finished, and that’s all.
