## v1.0.2 - Preface

First, I made a big mistake — since UCT was updated to v1.0.2, there have been many updates, but its version number has remained at v1.0.2. This is the result of long-term neglect of the update log.

In fact, the initial update of UCT to v1.0.0 was, in a sense, a mistake — I thought my template was finished at that time, but it seems that there is still much to be done. However, changing the version number back would be more troublesome. So, for now, let's leave it as it is.

In the last update of v1.0.2, I added this file — **CHANGELOG.md**, to record the content of each update and the plans for the next update.

The version number updates will follow this rule:

1. When a **PATCH** update occurs (the **X** in 1.0.X), it usually means this update is a bug fix or modification/refactoring of existing functionality, without adding new features or content.
2. When a **MINOR** update occurs (the **X** in 1.X.0), it usually means this update adds new features or content.
3. When a **MAJOR** update occurs (the **X** in X.0.0), it typically means… <small>*Well, I guess MAJOR will never change.*</small>
4. Before updating to the next version, a suffix -part X will be added to the version number, where X is the number of completed tasks.

The format for updates is as follows:

#### vX.X.0 -> vX.X.1 Summary of Updates

- [x] Task 1 (Completed)
- [x] Task 2 (Completed)

Year/Month/Day Plan

Year/Month/Day Completion

#### vX.X.1 -> vX.X.2 Summary of Updates

- [ ] Task 1 (Uncompleted)
- [ ] Task 2 (Uncompleted)

Year/Month/Day Plan (x-x items)

Year/Month/Day Completion

Completion time refers to the time when the last item is completed, as stated above.
