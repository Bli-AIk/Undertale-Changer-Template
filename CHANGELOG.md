## v1.0.2 - Preface

First, I made a big mistake—since the update of UCT to v1.0.2, there have been many updates, yet its version number still stays at v1.0.2. This is the result of long-term neglect of the update log.

In fact, the initial update of UCT to v1.0.0 was, in some sense, a mistake—I thought my template was complete at that time, but it seems that I still have a long way to go. However, changing the version number back would be more troublesome. So, let it be for now.

In the last update of v1.0.2, I added this file—**CHANGELOG.md**—to record the contents of each update and the plans for the next update.

Version number updates will follow this rule:

1. When a **PATCH** update occurs (in 1.0.X for **X**), it typically means this update is a bug fix or modification/refactor of existing features, without adding new functions or content.
2. When a **MINOR** update occurs (in 1.X.0 for **X**), it usually means this update adds new features or content.
3. When a **MAJOR** update occurs (in X.0.0 for **X**), it usually means... <small>*Well, I guess the MAJOR version will never change.*</small>
4. Before updating to the next version, a suffix -part X will be added to the version number. X represents the number of completed tasks.

The format for updates is as follows:

#### vX.X.0 -> vX.X.1 Update Overview

- [x] Task 1 (Completed)
- [x] Task 2 (Completed)

YYYY/MM/DD Plan

YYYY/MM/DD Completed

#### vX.X.1 -> vX.X.2 Update Overview

- [ ] Task 1 (Not Completed)
- [ ] Task 2 (Not Completed)

YYYY/MM/DD Plan (x-x item count)

YYYY/MM/DD Completed

The completion time refers to the time of the last task completed, as stated above.
