## v1.0.2 - Preface

First, I made a big mistake—since UCT updated to v1.0.2, there have been many updates, but its version number remains at v1.0.2. This is a result of neglecting the update log for a long time.

In fact, when UCT was updated to v1.0.0, it was, in some sense, a mistake—I thought my template was complete at that time, but it seems that it is still far from complete. However, it would be more troublesome to change the version number back. So, let it be for now.

In the last update of v1.0.2, I added this file—**CHANGELOG.md**—to record the content of each update and the plans for the next updates.

Version number updates will follow this rule:

1. When a **PATCH** update occurs (the **X** in 1.0.X), it usually means this update is a bug fix or modification/reconstruction of existing functions, without adding new features or content.
2. When a **MINOR** update occurs (the **X** in 1.X.0), it usually means this update adds new features or content.
3. When a **MAJOR** update occurs (the **X** in X.0.0), it usually means… <small>*Well, I guess MAJOR will never change.*</small>
4. When updating to the next version, a suffix -part X will be added to the version number. X is the number of completed task items.

The format for updates is as follows:

#### vX.X.0 -> vX.X.1 Update Summary

- [x] Task 1 (Completed)
- [x] Task 2 (Completed)

Date Plan

Date Completed

#### vX.X.1 -> vX.X.2 Update Summary

- [ ] Task 1 (Not Completed)
- [ ] Task 2 (Not Completed)

Date Plan (x-x item count)

Date Completed

The completed date is the date the last task was completed, and that's it.
