## v1.0.2 - Foreword

First, I made a big mistake—UCT has undergone many updates since it self-updated to v1.0.2, but its version number still remains at v1.0.2. This is the result of long-term neglect of the update log.

In fact, when we updated UCT to version v1.0.0, it was a mistake in some sense—I thought my template was finished at that time, but it seems that it still falls short. Nonetheless, changing the version number back would be more troublesome. So, let’s leave it as it is for now.

In the last update of v1.0.2, I added this file — **CHANGELOG.md**, to record the content of each update and the plans for the next update.

The version number update will follow this rule:

When a **PATCH** update occurs (in 1.0.X, where **X** is), it usually means that the update involves bug fixes or modifications/refactoring of existing features, rather than adding new features or content.
2. When the **MINOR** version is updated (the **X** in 1.X.0), it usually means that this update has added new features or content.
3. When **MAJOR** is updated (the **X** in X.0.0), it usually means…… <small>*Well, I guess MAJOR will never be modified.*</small>
Before updating to the next version, the version number will have the suffix -part X added. X represents the number of completed tasks.

The format of the update is as follows:

Overview of Updates from vX.X.0 to vX.X.1

- [x] Task 1 (Completed)
- [x] Task 2 (Completed)

XX Year/XX Month/XX Day Plan

Completed on XX Year/XX Month/XX Day.

#### Overview of Updates from vX.X.1 to vX.X.2

- [ ] Task 1 (incomplete)
- [ ] Task 2 (Incomplete)

Date: XX year/XX month/XX day plan (x-x items)

Completed on XX year/XX month/XX day.

The completion time refers to the time when the last item is completed.
