## About Version Number Changes

The format for UTR version numbers is:

<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>v1.X.X(f(n))(- partN(a))</strong></p>

The specific meanings are as follows:

1. **Major Version (1)**  
   - This may never change.

2. **Minor Version (X)**  
   - Changes when a category in the long-term update plan is completed.

3. **Patch Version (X)**  
   - Changes after completing a phased update.

4. **f(n)**  
   - Indicates that plans listed in the update log have changed.  
     - The first change is marked as `f`, subsequent changes as `f(n-1)` (for example, `f1` indicates the second change).
   - Changed plans will be temporarily listed in **[Updates Pending for Subsequent Versions](#后续版本待定更新)**.

5. **- partN(a)**  
   - Indicates specific progress in phased updates, with detailed update items written in this document.  
     - `partN`: Nth update completed within the phase.  
     - `partN(a)`: a minor update completed for the Nth item.

## v1.0.2 - Preface

Firstly, I made a big mistake—since UCT updated to v1.0.2, there have been many updates, yet its version number has remained at v1.0.2. This results from long neglecting the update log.

In fact, the initial update of UCT to v1.0.0 was somewhat erroneous—I thought my template was complete at that time, but looking back now, it still has a long way to go. Nevertheless, changing the version number back would be more troublesome. So, let's leave it as it is.

In the last update for v1.0.2, I added this file—**CHANGELOG.md**, to record the content of each update and the plans for the next update.

Version number updates will follow this rule:

1. When a **PATCH** update occurs (in 1.0.X, the **X**), it usually indicates that this update is for bug fixes or modifications/refactoring of existing functions, without adding new features or content.
2. When a **MINOR** update occurs (in 1.X.0, the **X**), it usually indicates that this update adds new features or content.
3. When a **MAJOR** update occurs (in X.0.0, the **X**), it usually indicates... <small>*Well, I guess MAJOR probably will never change.*</small>
4. Before updating to the next version, a suffix -part X will be added to the version number, where X is the number of completed task items.

The format for updates is as follows:

#### vX.X.0 -> vX.X.1 Overview of Update Content

- [x] Task 1 (Completed)
- [x] Task 2 (Completed)

Plans for XX year/XX month/XX day

Completed on XX year/XX month/XX day

#### vX.X.1 -> vX.X.2 Overview of Update Content

- [ ] Task 1 (Not completed)
- [ ] Task 2 (Not completed)

Plans for XX year/XX month/XX day (x-x items)

Completed on XX year/XX month/XX day

The completion date is the date of the last completed item.
