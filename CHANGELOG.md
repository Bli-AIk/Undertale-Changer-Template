     - The first change is marked as `f`, with subsequent changes labeled `f(n-1)` (e.g., `f1` indicates the second change).
   - Changed plans will be temporarily listed in **[Upcoming Versions to be Determined](#upcoming-versions-to-be-determined)**.

5. **- partN(a)**

## v1.0.2 - Preface

First of all, I made a big mistake—since UCT was updated to v1.0.2, there have been numerous updates, yet its version number remains at v1.0.2. This is the result of neglecting the update log for a long time.

In fact, initially updating UCT to v1.0.0 was, in a sense, incorrect—I thought my template had been completed back then, but now it appears far from it. However, it would be more troublesome to change the version number back. So let's leave it as is for now.

In the last update of v1.0.2, I added this file—**CHANGELOG.md**, to record the contents of each update and the plans for the next update.

The version number updates will follow these rules:

1. A **PATCH** update (in 1.0.X where **X**) typically means this update is a bug fix or modifications/refactoring of existing features, with no new features or content added.
2. A **MINOR** update (in 1.X.0 where **X**) typically means this update adds new features or content.
3. A **MAJOR** update (in X.0.0 where **X**) typically means… <small>*Well, I guess MAJOR will never change.*</small>
4. Before moving to the next version, the version number will have the suffix -part X, where X is the number of completed task items.

The update format is as follows:

#### vX.X.0 -> vX.X.1 Summary of Updates

- [x] Task 1 (Completed)
- [x] Task 2 (Completed)

Plans for XX year/XX month/XX day

Completion on XX year/XX month/XX day

#### vX.X.1 -> vX.X.2 Summary of Updates

- [ ] Task 1 (Not Completed)
- [ ] Task 2 (Not Completed)

Plans for XX year/XX month/XX day (x-x item count)

Completion on XX year/XX month/XX day

The completion date is that of the last completed item.
