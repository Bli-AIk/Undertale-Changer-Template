## v1.0.2 - Preface

First, I made a big mistake—since UCT self-updated to v1.0.2, there have been many updates, but its version number still remains at v1.0.2. This is the result of neglecting the update log for a long time.

In fact, when the version of UCT was updated to v1.0.0, it was somewhat of a mistake—in a way, I thought my template was complete, but now it seems there's still much to improve. However, changing the version number back would be more troublesome. So, let's leave it at that for now.

In the last update of version 1.0.2, I added this file—**CHANGELOG.md**, to record the contents of each update and the plans for the next update.

Version number updates will follow this rule:

When a **PATCH** update occurs (in 1.0.X, where **X** is the version number), it usually means that this update is for bug fixes or modifications/refactoring of existing features, without adding new features or content.
2. When a **MINOR** update occurs (in 1.X.0, **X**), it usually means that this update adds new features or content.
3. When **MAJOR** is updated (the **X** in X.0.0), it usually means… <small>*Well, I estimate that MAJOR will never be modified.*</small>
4. Before updating to the next version, a suffix -part X will be added to the version number. X represents the number of completed tasks.

The updated format is as follows:

Overview of updates from vX.X.0 to vX.X.1

- [x] Task 1 (Completed)
- [x] Task 2 (Completed)

Plan for XX year/XX month/XX day

Completed on XX year/XX month/XX day

#### Overview of Updates from vX.X.1 to vX.X.2

- [ ] Task 1 (not completed)
- [ ] Task 2 (not completed)

XX Year/XX Month/XX Day Plan (x-x items)

Completed on XX year/XX month/XX day

The completion time is the time of the last item completed, and that's it.
