## About Version Number Changes

The version number format for UTR is:

<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>v1.X.X(f(n))(- partN(a))</strong></p>

The specific meanings are as follows:

1. **Major Version Number (1)** 
   - This may never change.

2. **Minor Version Number (X)** 
   - Changes when a category in the long-term update plan is completed.

3. **Patch Version Number (X)** 
   - Changes after a phase of updates is completed.

4. **f(n)** 
   - Indicates that the plans listed in the update log have changed. 
     - The first change is marked as `f`, and subsequent changes as `f(n-1)` (e.g., `f1` indicates the second change).
   - Changed plans will be temporarily included in **[Postponed Updates](#后续版本待定更新)**.

5. **- partN(a)** 
   - Indicates specific progress in phase updates, with concrete updates listed in this document. 
     - `partN`: Indicates the completion of the N-th update in the phase. 
     - `partN(a)`: Completion of the a-th minor update for the N-th update.

## v1.0.2 - Preface

First, I made a big mistake—since UCT updated to v1.0.2, there have been many updates, yet its version number remains at v1.0.2. This is a result of long-term neglect of the update log.

In fact, when the version was updated to v1.0.0, it was, in a certain sense, a mistake—I thought my template was finished at that time, but now it seems there is still a long way to go. However, changing the version number back would complicate things even more. So, let’s leave it as it is for now.

In the last update of v1.0.2, I added this file—**CHANGELOG.md**—to record the contents of each update and plans for the next update.

The version update rules are as follows:

1. When a **PATCH** update occurs (X in 1.0.X), it usually means this update is a bug fix or a modification/refactoring of existing features, without adding new features or content.
2. When a **MINOR** update occurs (X in 1.X.0), it usually means this update adds new features or content.
3. When a **MAJOR** update occurs (X in X.0.0), it usually means…<small>*Alright, I guess MAJOR will never really change.*</small>
4. Before updating to the next version, a suffix -part X will be added to the version number. X represents the number of completed tasks.

The update format is as follows:

#### vX.X.0 -> vX.X.1 Summary of Updates

- [x] Task 1 (Completed)
- [x] Task 2 (Completed)

XX Year/XX Month/XX Day Plans

XX Year/XX Month/XX Day Completed

#### vX.X.1 -> vX.X.2 Summary of Updates

- [ ] Task 1 (Not completed)
- [ ] Task 2 (Not completed)

XX Year/XX Month/XX Day Plans (x-x items)

XX Year/XX Month/XX Day Completed

The completion time is the time of the last item completed, above.
