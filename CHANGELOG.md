## v1.0.2 - Preface

First, I made a big mistake—since UCT updated to v1.0.2, there have been many updates, but its version number remains stuck at v1.0.2. This is the result of long-term neglect of the update log.

In fact, updating UCT to v1.0.0 was, in a sense, a mistake—at that time, I thought my template was complete, but now it seems there is still much to improve. However, changing the version number back would be more troublesome. So, let's leave it as it is for now.

In the last update of v1.0.2, I added this file—**CHANGELOG.md**—as an update log to record the contents of each update and the plans for the next update.

The version number updates will follow this rule:

1. When a **PATCH** update occurs (within 1.0.X, the **X**), it typically means that this update is for bug fixes or modifications/refactoring of existing features, without adding new features or content.
2. When a **MINOR** update occurs (within 1.X.0, the **X**), it typically means that this update adds new features or content.
3. When a **MAJOR** update occurs (within X.0.0, the **X**), it usually means... <small>*Well, I guess MAJOR will never change.*</small>
4. Before updating to the next version, a suffix -part X will be added to the version number, where X is the number of completed tasks.

The update format is as follows:

#### vX.X.0 -> vX.X.1 Update Summary

- [x] Task 1 (Completed)
- [x] Task 2 (Completed)

Year/Month/Day Plan

Year/Month/Day Completed

#### vX.X.1 -> vX.X.2 Update Summary

- [ ] Task 1 (Incomplete)
- [ ] Task 2 (Incomplete)

Year/Month/Day Plan (x-x tasks)

Year/Month/Day Completed

The completion time is the time of the last completed task, as above.
