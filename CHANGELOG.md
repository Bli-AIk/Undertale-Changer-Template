3. **Patch Version (X)**  
   - Changes after completing a phase update.

4. **f(n)**  
   - Indicates that a plan listed in the changelog has changed.  
     - The first change is marked as `f`, subsequent changes as `f(n-1)` (e.g., `f1` indicates the second change).  
   - Changed plans will be temporarily included in **[Pending Updates](#pending-updates)**.

5. **- partN(a)**  
   - Indicates specific progress within a phase update, with specific updates listed in this document.

## v1.0.2 - Preface

First, I made a big mistake—since UCT updated to v1.0.2, there have been many updates, but its version number has remained at v1.0.2. This is the result of long-term neglect of the changelog.

In fact, at the time UCT was updated to v1.0.0, it was, in some sense, a mistake—back then I thought my template was complete, but now it seems far from it. Regardless, changing the version number back would be more troublesome. So, it stays as is.

In the last update of v1.0.2, I added this file—**CHANGELOG.md**, to record the contents of each update and plans for the next one.

Version number updates will follow this rule:

1. When a **PATCH** update occurs (in 1.0.X where **X** represents), it usually means this update involves bug fixes or modifications/refactorings of existing features without adding new functions or content.
2. When a **MINOR** update occurs (in 1.X.0 where **X** represents), it usually means this update adds new features or content.
3. When a **MAJOR** update occurs (in X.0.0 where **X** represents), it usually means… <small>*Well, I guess the MAJOR will never change.*</small>
4. Before updating to the next version, a suffix -part X will be added to the version number, where X is the number of completed tasks.

The update format is as follows:

#### vX.X.0 -> vX.X.1 Update Summary

- [x] Task 1 (completed)
- [x] Task 2 (completed)

XX Year/XX Month/XX Day Plans

XX Year/XX Month/XX Day Completed

#### vX.X.1 -> vX.X.2 Update Summary

- [ ] Task 1 (not completed)
- [ ] Task 2 (not completed)

XX Year/XX Month/XX Day Plans (x-x items)

XX Year/XX Month/XX Day Completed

The completion time is the date of the last completed task, as above.
