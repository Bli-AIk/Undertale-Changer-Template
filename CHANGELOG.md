## About Version Number Changes

The version number format for UTR is:

<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>v1.X.X(f(n))(- partN(a))</strong></p>

The specific meanings are as follows:

1. **Major Version Number (1)**
   - This may never change.

2. **Minor Version Number (X)**
   - Changes when a category in the long-term update plan is completed.

3. **Patch Version Number (X)**
   - Changes after completing a phase update.

4. **f(n)**
   - Indicates that the plans listed in the update log have changed.
     - The first change is marked as `f`, subsequent changes as `f(n-1)` (e.g., `f1` indicates the second change).
   - Plans that have changed will be temporarily listed in **[Subsequent Version Pending Update](#subsequent-version-pending-update)**.

5. **- partN(a)**
   - Indicates specific progress in a phase update, with details included in this document.
     - `partN`: Nth completed update within the phase.
     - `partN(a)`: the a-th minor update of the Nth update.

## v1.0.2 - Preface

First, I made a big mistake—since UCT was updated to v1.0.2, there have been many updates, but its version number remains at v1.0.2. This is the result of long-term neglect of the update log.

In fact, updating UCT to v1.0.0 was, in a sense, a mistake—at that time, I thought my template was complete, but now it appears still far from it. Regardless, changing the version number back would be more troublesome. So let's leave it as it is for now.

In the last update of v1.0.2, I added this file—**CHANGELOG.md**—to record the content of each update and the plans for the next update.

The version number updates will follow this rule:

1. When a **PATCH** update occurs (in 1.0.X, the **X**), it usually means this update is a bug fix or a modification/refactoring of existing functionality, without adding new features or content.
2. When a **MINOR** update occurs (in 1.X.0, the **X**), it usually means this update adds new features or content.
3. When a **MAJOR** update occurs (in X.0.0, the **X**), it typically means... <small>*Well, I suspect MAJOR will never change.*</small>
4. Before updating to the next version, a suffix -part X will be added to the version number. X signifies the number of completed tasks.

The update format is as follows:

#### vX.X.0 -> vX.X.1 Update Overview

- [x] Task 1 (Completed)
- [x] Task 2 (Completed)

XX/YYYY Plan

XX/YYYY Completion

#### vX.X.1 -> vX.X.2 Update Overview

- [ ] Task 1 (Incomplete)
- [ ] Task 2 (Incomplete)

XX/YYYY Plan (x-x tasks)

XX/YYYY Completion

The completion time is the time when the last task is completed, and that's it.
