## About Version Number Changes

The version number format for UTR is:

<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>v1.X.X(f(n))(- partN(a))</strong></p>

The specific meanings are as follows:

1. **Major Version (1)** 
   - This may never change.

2. **Minor Version (X)** 
   - Changes when completing a certain category in the long-term update plan.

3. **Patch Version (X)** 
   - Changes upon completing a phased update.

4. **f(n)** 
   - Indicates that the plans listed in the update log have changed. 
     - The first change is marked as `f`, subsequent changes are `f(n-1)` (e.g., `f1` indicates a second change).
   - Changed plans will temporarily be included in **[Pending Updates for Subsequent Versions](#Pending-Updates-for-Subsequent-Versions)**.

5. **- partN(a)** 
   - Indicates specific progress within a phased update, with detailed update items written in this document. 
     - `partN`: The Nth update completed within the phase. 
     - `partN(a)`: The a-th small update of the Nth item is completed.

## v1.0.2 - Foreword

First, I made a big mistake—since the update to v1.0.2, UCT has undergone many updates, yet its version number remains at v1.0.2. This is a result of long-term neglect of the update log.

In fact, updating UCT to version 1.0.0 was, in a sense, a mistake—I thought my template was finished at that time, but now it seems there is still much work to do. Nevertheless, reverting the version number would be more troublesome. So, let's leave it at this for now.

In the last update of v1.0.2, I added this file—**CHANGELOG.md**—to record the contents of each update and plans for the next update.

Version number updates will follow this rule:

1. When a **PATCH** update occurs (in 1.0.X **X**), it usually means this update is a bug fix or a modification/refactoring of existing functionalities without adding new features or content.
2. When a **MINOR** update occurs (in 1.X.0 **X**), it usually means this update adds new features or content.
3. When a **MAJOR** update occurs (in X.0.0 **X**), it usually means... <small>*Well, I guess the MAJOR version will never change.*</small>
4. Before moving to the next version, the version number will have a suffix -part X. X is the count of completed task items.

The update format is as follows:

#### vX.X.0 -> vX.X.1 Overview of Updates

- [x] Task 1 (completed)
- [x] Task 2 (completed)

Plans for XX/XX/XX

Completed on XX/XX/XX

#### vX.X.1 -> vX.X.2 Overview of Updates

- [ ] Task 1 (not completed)
- [ ] Task 2 (not completed)

Plans for XX/XX/XX (x-x items)

Completed on XX/XX/XX

The completion time is the time the last item was finished, and that's that.
