## About Version Number Changes

The version number format for UTR is:

<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>v1.X.X(f(n))(- partN(a))</strong></p>

The specific meanings are as follows:

1. **Major Version Number (1)** 
   - This may never change.

2. **Minor Version Number (X)** 
   - Changes when a category in the long-term update plan is completed.

3. **Patch Version Number (X)** 
   - Changes after a phased update is completed.

4. **f(n)** 
   - Indicates that a plan listed in the update log has changed. 
     - The first change is marked as `f`, subsequent changes are `f(n-1)` (e.g., `f1` indicates a second change).
   - Changed plans will be temporarily listed in **[Pending Updates for Future Versions](#后续版本待定更新)**.

5. **- partN(a)** 
   - Indicates specific progress in a phased update, with specific update items written in this document. 
     - `partN`: The N-th update completed in the phase. 
     - `partN(a)`: The a-th minor update of the N-th update completed.

## v1.0.2 - Preface

First, I made a big mistake—since UCT updated to v1.0.2, there have been many updates, yet the version number remains at v1.0.2. This is a result of neglecting the update log for a long time.

In fact, updating UCT to v1.0.0 was a mistake on some level—I thought my template was finished at that time, but it is clear now that there's still a long way to go. Nevertheless, reverting the version number would be more troublesome. So, let's leave it as is for now.

In the last update of v1.0.2, I added this file—**CHANGELOG.md**, to record the content of each update and the plans for the next updates.

Version number updates will follow this rule:

1. When a **PATCH** update occurs (within 1.0.X, **X**), it typically means this update is for bug fixes or modifications/refactoring of existing features, without adding any new features or content.
2. When a **MINOR** update occurs (within 1.X.0, **X**), it generally means this update adds new features or content.
3. When a **MAJOR** update occurs (within X.0.0, **X**), it typically implies… <small>*Well, I guess MAJOR will never change.*</small>
4. Before moving to the next version, a suffix of -part X will be added to the version number. X denotes the number of completed task items.

The update format is as follows:

#### vX.X.0 -> vX.X.1 Update Overview

- [x] Task 1 (Completed)
- [x] Task 2 (Completed)

Scheduled for XX/XX/XX

Completed on XX/XX/XX

#### vX.X.1 -> vX.X.2 Update Overview

- [ ] Task 1 (Not Completed)
- [ ] Task 2 (Not Completed)

Scheduled for XX/XX/XX (x-x items)

Completed on XX/XX/XX

The completion date refers to the time of the last completed item.
