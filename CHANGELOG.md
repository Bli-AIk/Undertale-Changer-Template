## v1.0.2 - Preface

First, I made a big mistake—UCT has gone through many updates since the update to v1.0.2, but its version number has still remained at v1.0.2. This is a result of neglecting the update log for a long time.

In fact, updating UCT to version v1.0.0 was, in some sense, a mistake—at that time, I thought my template was completed, but it seems far from it now. However, reverting the version number would be more troublesome. So, let's leave it as it is for now.

In the last update for v1.0.2, I added this file—**CHANGELOG.md**—to record the contents of each update and the plans for the next updates.

The version number updates will follow this rule:

1. When a **PATCH** update occurs (the **X** in 1.0.X), it usually signifies that this update is a bug fix or a modification/refactor of existing features, without adding new features or content.
2. When a **MINOR** update occurs (the **X** in 1.X.0), it usually means that new features or content are added.
3. When a **MAJOR** update occurs (the **X** in X.0.0), it usually means... <small>*Well, I guess MAJOR will probably never change.*</small>
4. Before updating to the next version, the version number will have a suffix -part X. X represents the number of completed tasks.

The update format is as follows:

#### vX.X.0 -> vX.X.1 Update Overview

- [x] Task 1 (Completed)
- [x] Task 2 (Completed)

YYYY/MM/DD Plan

YYYY/MM/DD Completed

#### vX.X.1 -> vX.X.2 Update Overview

- [ ] Task 1 (Not Completed)
- [ ] Task 2 (Not Completed)

YYYY/MM/DD Plan (x-x items)

YYYY/MM/DD Completed

The completion date is the date the last item was completed.
