## v1.0.2 - Preface

First, I made a big mistake—since UCT was updated to v1.0.2, many updates have occurred, but the version number has remained at v1.0.2. This is the result of long-term neglect of the update log.

In fact, updating UCT to v1.0.0 was, in a sense, a mistake—at that time, I believed my template was complete, but now it seems much more work is necessary. Nevertheless, changing the version number back would be more troublesome. So, this will do for now.

In the last update for v1.0.2, I added this file—**CHANGELOG.md**, to document every update and the plans for the next one.

Version updates will follow this rule:

1. When a **PATCH** update occurs (in 1.0.X, the **X**), it usually means this update addresses bug fixes or modifications/refactoring of existing features, with no new functionality or content added.
2. When a **MINOR** update occurs (in 1.X.0, the **X**), it usually means this update adds new functionalities or content.
3. When a **MAJOR** update occurs (in X.0.0, the **X**), it usually means… <small>*Well, I guess MAJOR will never change.*</small>
4. Before moving to the next version, the version number will be suffixed with -part X, where X is the number of completed tasks.

The update format is as follows:

#### vX.X.0 -> vX.X.1 Overview of Update Content

- [x] Task 1 (Completed)
- [x] Task 2 (Completed)

Planned for XX Year / XX Month / XX Day

Completed on XX Year / XX Month / XX Day

#### vX.X.1 -> vX.X.2 Overview of Update Content

- [ ] Task 1 (Incomplete)
- [ ] Task 2 (Incomplete)

Planned for XX Year / XX Month / XX Day (x-x items)

Completed on XX Year / XX Month / XX Day

Completion time refers to the time the last task was completed, and that’s it.
