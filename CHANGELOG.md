## v1.0.2 - Introduction

First, I made a big mistake—UCT has undergone many updates since it was updated to v1.0.2, but its version number has still remained at v1.0.2. This is the result of ignoring the update log for a long time.

In fact, the initial update of UCT to version v1.0.0 was, in a sense, a mistake—at that time, I thought my template was complete, but it seems far from satisfactory now. However, changing the version number back would be more troublesome. So, let's leave it as is for now.

In the last update of v1.0.2, I added this file—**CHANGELOG.md**, to record the content of each update and the plans for the next update.

Version number updates will follow this rule:

1. When a **PATCH** update occurs (in 1.0.X, **X**), it usually indicates that this update is a bug fix or modification/refactoring of existing functions, with no new functions or content added.
2. When a **MINOR** update occurs (in 1.X.0, **X**), it usually indicates that this update adds new functions or content.
3. When a **MAJOR** update occurs (in X.0.0, **X**), it usually signifies... <small>*Well, I guess MAJOR will never change.*</small>
4. Before updating to the next version, a suffix -part X will be added to the version number. X represents the number of completed task items.

The update format is as follows:

#### vX.X.0 -> vX.X.1 Update Overview

- [x] Task 1 (Completed)
- [x] Task 2 (Completed)

Year/Month/Day Plan

Year/Month/Day Completed

#### vX.X.1 -> vX.X.2 Update Overview

- [ ] Task 1 (Not Completed)
- [ ] Task 2 (Not Completed)

Year/Month/Day Plan (x-x items count)

Year/Month/Day Completed

The completion time indicates when the last item was completed, that's all.
