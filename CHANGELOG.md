## v1.0.2 - Foreword

First, I made a big mistake—since UCT updated to v1.0.2, there have been many updates, yet its version number remains at v1.0.2. This is the result of long-term neglect of the update log.

In fact, it was a mistake to update UCT to v1.0.0 at that time—in some sense, I thought my template was completed, but it appears there is still much room for improvement. Regardless, reverting the version number would be more troublesome. So, let it be for now.

In the last update of v1.0.2, I added this file—**CHANGELOG.md**—to record the content of each update and plans for the next one.

Version number updates will follow this rule:

1. When a **PATCH** update occurs (the **X** in 1.0.X), it usually means this update is for bug fixes or modifications/refactoring of existing functionality, without adding new features or content.
2. When a **MINOR** update occurs (the **X** in 1.X.0), it usually means this update adds new features or content.
3. When a **MAJOR** update occurs (the **X** in X.0.0), it usually means… <small>*Well, I don't expect MAJOR will ever change.*</small>
4. Before updating to the next version, a suffix -part X will be added to the version number. X represents the number of completed task items.

The format for updates is as follows:

#### vX.X.0 -> vX.X.1 Overview of Update Content

- [x] Task 1 (Completed)
- [x] Task 2 (Completed)

YY Year/YY Month/YY Day Plan

YY Year/YY Month/YY Day Completed

#### vX.X.1 -> vX.X.2 Overview of Update Content

- [ ] Task 1 (Unfinished)
- [ ] Task 2 (Unfinished)

YY Year/YY Month/YY Day Plan (x-x item count)

YY Year/YY Month/YY Day Completed

The completion time is the time when the last item is completed, above.
