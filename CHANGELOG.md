## v1.0.2 - Preface

First, I made a big mistake—since UCT was updated to v1.0.2, there have been many updates, but its version number has remained at v1.0.2. This is the result of long-term neglect of the update log.

In fact, updating UCT to version 1.0.0 was a mistake in some sense—I thought my template was complete then, but it now appears to be far from it. Nevertheless, changing the version number back would be more troublesome. So, let's leave it as it is for now.

In the last update for v1.0.2, I added this file—**CHANGELOG.md**—to record the content of each update and plans for the next update.

Version number updates will follow this rule:

1. When a **PATCH** update occurs (in 1.0.X, the **X**), it usually means this update is a bug fix or modification/refactoring of existing features, without adding new features or content.
2. When a **MINOR** update occurs (in 1.X.0, the **X**), it usually means this update adds new features or content.
3. When a **MAJOR** update occurs (in X.0.0, the **X**), it usually means... <small>*Well, I guess MAJOR will never change.*</small>
4. Before updating to the next version, the version number will have a suffix -part X. X represents the number of completed tasks.

The update format is as follows:

#### vX.X.0 -> vX.X.1 Overview of Update Content

- [x] Task 1 (Completed)
- [x] Task 2 (Completed)

Planned for XX/XX/XX

Completed on XX/XX/XX

#### vX.X.1 -> vX.X.2 Overview of Update Content

- [ ] Task 1 (Not Completed)
- [ ] Task 2 (Not Completed)

Planned for XX/XX/XX (x-x tasks)

Completed on XX/XX/XX

The completion time refers to the time when the last task was completed, and that's it.
