## v1.0.2 - Preface

First, I made a big mistake—since UCT was updated to v1.0.2, there have been numerous updates, yet its version number remains at v1.0.2. This is a result of neglecting the update log for a long time.

In fact, at the time of updating UCT to v1.0.0, it was somewhat of a mistake—back then, I believed my template was complete, but it now seems there is still a long way to go. However, changing the version number back would be more troublesome, so we’ll just leave it as is for now.

In the final update of v1.0.2, I added this file—**CHANGELOG.md**—to record the contents of each update and the plans for the next update in the update log.

The version number will be updated according to the following rules:

1. When a **PATCH** update occurs (the **X** in 1.0.X), it usually means this update involves bug fixes or modifications/refactoring of existing features without adding new functionalities or content.
2. When a **MINOR** update occurs (the **X** in 1.X.0), it typically means this update adds new functionalities or content.
3. When a **MAJOR** update occurs (the **X** in X.0.0), it generally means... <small>*Well, I guess a MAJOR will never really change.*</small>
4. Before updating to the next version, a suffix -part X will be added to the version number, where X represents the number of completed tasks.

The update format is as follows:

#### vX.X.0 -> vX.X.1 Overview of Updates

- [x] Task 1 (Completed)
- [x] Task 2 (Completed)

XX Year/XX Month/XX Day Plan

XX Year/XX Month/XX Day Completed

#### vX.X.1 -> vX.X.2 Overview of Updates

- [ ] Task 1 (Not Completed)
- [ ] Task 2 (Not Completed)

XX Year/XX Month/XX Day Plan (x-x tasks)

XX Year/XX Month/XX Day Completed

The completion time is the time of the last item completed, and that's all.
