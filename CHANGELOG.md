## v1.0.2 - Preface

First of all I made a big mistake - UCT has gone through a very large number of updates since it was updated to v1.0.2, but its version number is still stuck at v1.0.2. This is the result of ignoring the changelog for a long time.

In fact, updating the version of UCT to v1.0.0 in the first place was wrong in a sense - I thought I had the template made then, but it still looks much worse now. But anyway, changing the version number back would be more trouble than it's worth. So, that's it for now.

In the last update for v1.0.2, I added this new file - **CHANGELOG.md** - as an update log to record each update and the plan for the next one.

Version number updates will be based on this rule:

1. when **PATCH** is updated (**X** in 1.0.X), it usually means that the update is a bug fix or a modification/refactoring of the original functionality, and no new functionality or content has been added.
2. When **MINOR** is updated (**X** in 1.X.0), it usually means that the update adds new functionality or content.
3. When **MAJOR** is updated (**X** in X.0.0), it usually means that ...... <small>*Well, I'm guessing MAJOR will never be changed. *</small>
4. When updating until the next version, the version number is suffixed with -part X. X is the number of task items completed.

The format of the update is as follows:

#### vX.X.0 -> vX.X.1 Overview of updates

- [x] Task 1 (completed)
- [x] Task 2 (completed)

XX/XX/XX/XX/XX Plan

XX/XX/XX Completed

#### vX.X.1 -> vX.X.2 Overview of Updates

- [ ] Task 1 (not completed)
- [ ] Task 2 (not completed)

XX/XX/XX/XX/XX Plan (x-x number of items)

XX/XX/XX Completed

The time of completion is when the last item was completed above.
