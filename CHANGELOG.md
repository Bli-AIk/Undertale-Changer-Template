## v1.0.2 - Preface

First, I made a big mistake—since UCT updated to v1.0.2, there have been numerous updates, yet its version number remains at v1.0.2. This is the result of long-term neglect of the update log.

In fact, updating UCT to v1.0.0 was somewhat of a mistake—at that time I thought my template was complete, but it turns out it's still lacking in many aspects. However, changing the version number back would be more troublesome, so I will leave it as is for now.

In the last update for v1.0.2, I introduced this file—**CHANGELOG.md**, as a record of each update and the plans for the next update.

The version number updates will follow these rules:

1. When a **PATCH** update occurs (1.0.X in which **X** is incremented), it usually means this update is for bug fixes or modifications/refactoring of existing features without adding new features or content.
2. When a **MINOR** update occurs (1.X.0 in which **X** is incremented), it usually means this update adds new features or content.
3. When a **MAJOR** update occurs (X.0.0 in which **X** is incremented), it usually means… <small>*Well, I guess MAJOR will never change.*</small>
4. Before updating to the next version, a suffix -part X will be added to the version number, with X being the number of completed task items.

The update format is as follows:

#### vX.X.0 -> vX.X.1 Summary of Updates

- [x] Task 1 (Completed)
- [x] Task 2 (Completed)

Plans for XX/XX/XX

Completion on XX/XX/XX

#### vX.X.1 -> vX.X.2 Summary of Updates

- [ ] Task 1 (Not Completed)
- [ ] Task 2 (Not Completed)

Plans for XX/XX/XX (x-x items)

Completion on XX/XX/XX

The completion date is the date the last item was completed.
