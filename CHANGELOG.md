## v1.0.2 - Preface

First of all, I made a big mistake — UCT has been updated many times since self-updating to v1.0.2, but its version number still remains at v1.0.2. This is the result of long-term neglect of the update log.

In fact, updating UCT to version 1.0.0 was, in a sense, a mistake—I thought my template was finished at that time, but it now seems to be far from adequate. Nevertheless, changing the version number back would be more troublesome. So, let's leave it as it is for now.

In the last update of version 1.0.2, I added this file—**CHANGELOG.md**—to record the content of each update and the plans for the next update.

The version number updates will follow this rule:

1. When a **PATCH** update occurs (the **X** in 1.0.X), it usually means that this update includes bug fixes or modifications/refactoring of existing features, without adding new functionalities or content.
2. When a **MINOR** update occurs (within 1.X.0 where **X** is specified), it usually means that new features or content have been added in this update.
3. When **MAJOR** is updated (in X.0.0, the **X**), it usually means... <small>*Well, I guess MAJOR will never be modified.*</small>
4. Before updating to the next version, the version number will be followed by the suffix -part X, where X is the number of completed tasks.

The updated format is as follows:

#### vX.X.0 -> vX.X.1 Update Overview

- [x] Task 1 (Completed)
- [x] Task 2 (Completed)

XX Year/XX Month/XX Day Plan

Completed on XX year / XX month / XX day.

#### vX.X.1 -> vX.X.2 Update Overview

Task 1 (Not Completed)
Task 2 (not completed)

XX Year/XX Month/XX Day Plan (x-x items)

Completed on XX year/XX month/XX day.

The completion time refers to the time when the last item is completed, as stated above.

The translation of "2024/11/4 计划" to English is "Plan for November 4, 2024."

November 4, 2024 completed
