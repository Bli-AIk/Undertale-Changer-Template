## About Version Number Changes

The version number format for UTR is:

<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>v1.X.X(f(n))(- partN(a))</strong></p>

The specific meanings are as follows:

1. **Major Version Number (1)** 
   - This is unlikely to change.

2. **Minor Version Number (X)** 
   - Changes when one category of the long-term update plan is completed.

3. **Patch Version Number (X)** 
   - Changes after completing a phased update.

4. **f(n)** 
   - Indicates that the plans listed in the update log have changed. 
     - The first change is marked as `f`, and subsequent changes are `f(n-1)` (e.g., `f1` indicates the second change).
   - Changed plans will be temporarily listed in **[Pending Updates for Subsequent Versions](#後續版本待定更新)**.

5. **- partN(a)** 
   - Represents specific progress in the phased update, with updates detailed within this document. 
     - `partN`: The N-th update is completed within the phase. 
     - `partN(a)`: The a-th small update of the N-th update is completed.

## v1.0.2 - Preface

First of all, I made a big mistake—since the update of UCT to v1.0.2, there have been numerous updates, but its version number still remains at v1.0.2. This is the result of long-term neglect of the update log.

In fact, the initial update to UCT v1.0.0 was, in a sense, a mistake—I thought at that time that my template was completed, but it seems now that it is still far from that. Nevertheless, changing the version number back would be more troublesome. So let's leave it as is for now.

In the last update of v1.0.2, I added this file—**CHANGELOG.md**—as a record of the content of each update and plans for the next update.

Version number updates will follow this rule:

1. When a **PATCH** update occurs (X in 1.0.X), it typically means this update is a bug fix or restructuring of existing features, without adding new functions or content.
2. When a **MINOR** update occurs (X in 1.X.0), it usually means this update adds new features or content.
3. When a **MAJOR** update occurs (X in X.0.0), it typically means… <small>*Well, I guess MAJOR will never change.*</small>
4. Before updating to the next version, the version number will have the suffix -part X, where X is the number of completed tasks.

The format of updates is as follows:

#### vX.X.0 -> vX.X.1 Overview of Update Content

- [x] Task 1 (completed)
- [x] Task 2 (completed)

Date XX/XX/XX Plan

Date XX/XX/XX Completed

#### vX.X.1 -> vX.X.2 Overview of Update Content

- [ ] Task 1 (not completed)
- [ ] Task 2 (not completed)

Date XX/XX/XX Plan (x-x task count)

Date XX/XX/XX Completed

The completion time is the time of the last completed task, as mentioned above.
