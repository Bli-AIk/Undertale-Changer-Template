## v1.0.2 - Preface

First, I made a big mistake—since the update of UCT to v1.0.2, there have been many updates, but its version number has still remained at v1.0.2. This is the result of long-term neglect of the update log.

In fact, updating UCT to v1.0.0 in the first place was, in some sense, a mistake—I thought my template was complete then, but it now seems far from it. However, changing the version number back would be more troublesome. So, let’s leave it as it is for now.

In the last update of v1.0.2, I added this file—**CHANGELOG.md**, to record the contents of each update and the plans for the next update.

Version number updates will follow this rule:

1. When a **PATCH** update occurs (in 1.0.X, **X**), this usually means that the update is a bug fix or modification/refactor of existing features, without adding new functionalities or content.
2. When a **MINOR** update occurs (in 1.X.0, **X**), this usually means that the update adds new features or content.
3. When a **MAJOR** update occurs (in X.0.0, **X**), this usually means...... <small>*Well, I guess MAJOR will never change.*</small>
4. Before updating to the next version, a suffix -part X will be added to the version number, where X is the number of completed tasks.

The format of the update is as follows:

#### vX.X.0 -> vX.X.1 Overview of update content

- [x] Task 1 (Completed)
- [x] Task 2 (Completed)

Planned for XX year/XX month/XX day

Completed on XX year/XX month/XX day

#### vX.X.1 -> vX.X.2 Overview of update content

- [ ] Task 1 (Not completed)
- [ ] Task 2 (Not completed)

Planned for XX year/XX month/XX day (x-x tasks)

Completed on XX year/XX month/XX day

The completion date is the date of the last task completed, as above.

Planned for 2024/11/4
