## About Version Number Changes

The version number format for UTR is:

<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>v1.X.X(f(n))(- partN(a))</strong></p>

Its specific meaning is as follows:

1. **Major Version Number (1)** 
   - This may never change.

2. **Minor Version Number (X)** 
   - Changes when completing a class in the long-term update plan.

3. **Patch Version Number (X)** 
   - Changes after completing a phase update.

4. **f(n)** 
   - Indicates that the plans listed in the update log have changed. 
     - The first change is marked as `f`, and subsequent changes as `f(n-1)` (e.g., `f1` indicates the second change).
   - Changed plans will be temporarily listed under **[Pending Updates for Subsequent Versions](#后续版本待定更新)**.

5. **- partN(a)** 
   - Indicates specific progress in phase updates, the detailed updates are written in this document. 
     - `partN`: The N-th update completed in the phase. 
     - `partN(a)`: The a-th minor update completed for the N-th update.

## v1.0.2 - Preface

First, I made a big mistake—since UCT updated to v1.0.2, there have been numerous updates, but its version number has remained at v1.0.2. This is the result of neglecting the update log for a long time.

In fact, the initial update of UCT to v1.0.0 was, in some sense, a mistake—at that time I thought my template was finished, but now it seems there is still a long way to go. However, changing the version number back would be more troublesome. So let's leave it as is for now.

In the final update of v1.0.2, I added this file—**CHANGELOG.md**—to record the contents of each update and plans for the next update.

The version number updates will follow this rule:

1. When a **PATCH** update occurs (the **X** in 1.0.X), it generally means that this update is a bug fix or a modification/refactor of existing functions, without adding new features or content.
2. When a **MINOR** update occurs (the **X** in 1.X.0), it generally indicates that this update adds new features or content.
3. When a **MAJOR** update occurs (the **X** in X.0.0), it generally means… <small>*Well, I guess MAJOR will never change.*</small>
4. Before updating to the next version, the version number will have the suffix -part X, where X is the number of completed task items.

The update format is as follows:

#### vX.X.0 -> vX.X.1 Overview of Updates

- [x] Task 1 (Completed)
- [x] Task 2 (Completed)

XX Year/XX Month/XX Day Plan

XX Year/XX Month/XX Day Completed

#### vX.X.1 -> vX.X.2 Overview of Updates

- [ ] Task 1 (Not Completed)
- [ ] Task 2 (Not Completed)

XX Year/XX Month/XX Day Plan (x-x tasks)

XX Year/XX Month/XX Day Completed

The completion time is the time of the last item completed, that is all.
