### 3. Regarding Licenses for Reference Code (Not Involving Undertale Content)

The entire UCT project is currently released under the **Apache 2.0 License**. However, as the original author of the template, I would like to add the following:

> **If you only reference the code structure, functional implementation, or logical ideas in this template, and your final project does not contain any Undertale-related content or directly reuse files or resources from this project, then your use fully complies with Apache 2.0 and you may freely use it in personal or commercial projects. **

Please note:

* If your project reuses the original files, modules, or overall structure from this template, you must comply with the Apache 2.0 copyright notice and modification notice requirements.
* If your project includes content related to the original Undertale work (such as characters, music, or plot), please refer to the above instructions regarding secondary creation.

If you need further confirmation that your project's use complies with the above license, please add a note during development or contact me directly.

We encourage creativity and promote fair use and sharing. We also hope to help more developers realize their creativity while respecting the spirit of open source and the copyright of the original work.
