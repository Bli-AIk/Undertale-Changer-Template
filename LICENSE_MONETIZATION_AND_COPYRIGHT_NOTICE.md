## UCT License, Monetization, and Copyright Notice

Before using **Undertale Changer Template**, please make sure to understand the following:

### 1. About the Open Source License (GNU GPLv3)

The UCT project is licensed under the **GNU GPLv3 open source license**, which is a free software license with a strong "copyleft" nature. Please pay special attention to the following:

**According to the terms of the GNU GPLv3 license:**

- **You are allowed to:**
  - Use, study, and modify the project freely;
    - Develop privately without the need to open source your code;
      - Use the project for commercial purposes (including paid games, additional services, etc.) as long as you comply with GPLv3.

      - **You must comply with:**
        - Once you release the project (code or finished product), you must also release the corresponding source code;
          - Any modifications or extensions of this project must be released under the GPLv3 license;
            - You cannot restrict others from using, modifying, or redistributing your code.

            **Important Note:**

            > **While GPLv3 allows commercial use, if your project contains any elements from Undertale (such as characters, art, music, story, etc.), it will be considered a derivative work of Undertale.**<br>**You may not use such works for profit or commercial purposes without explicit permission from the original creator, Toby Fox.**

            This includes, but is not limited to:
            - Selling the finished product or charging fees;
            - Earning revenue through ads, in-app purchases, sponsorships, etc.;
            - Publishing the work commercially on any platform.

            **In short:**
            > **GPLv3 permits open source and commercial use, but Undertaleâ€™s licensing restrictions take precedence over the GPL terms. Derivative works cannot be monetized unless authorized by the original creators.**

            > **Under GPLv3, if you "release" a derivative work based on UCT containing Undertale elements, you must also release the source code and allow others to freely use it.**

            > Reference: [GNU GPLv3 Explanation](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0.en.html)

            ### 2. About Undertale Derivative Works and Copyright Issues

            Please note that UCT is a tool template designed specifically for **Undertale derivative works**, and its core is built on replicating the mechanics of the original game.

            - **The copyright of Undertale belongs to its creator, Toby Fox.**
            - This project is a **non-official fan project**, intended only for educational, research, and non-commercial use.

            Unless you have formal authorization from Toby Fox, **you may not use works containing Undertale elements (such as characters, music, art, story, etc.) for any commercial purposes**, including but not limited to:

            - Selling or charging fees;
            - Publishing for profit on platforms;
            - Monetizing through ads or paid content.

            ### 3. About the Licensing for Code that Only References Portions of the Template (Not Involving Undertale Content)

            The UCT project as a whole is licensed under the **GNU GPLv3**, but as the original author of the template, I would like to add the following licensing terms:

            > **If you only reference the code structure, functional implementation, or logic in this template and your final project does not contain any Undertale-related content or directly reuse files or resources from this project, then such usage is not subject to the GPLv3 restrictions.**

            To encourage learning and creation, we offer the following **additional license** for such "reference-only" use:

            > **Under the above conditions, the related code can be considered as licensed under the MIT license, allowing you to freely use it for personal or commercial projects without the need for attribution or source code disclosure.**

            Please note:
            - If your project does reuse original files, modules, or the overall structure from this template, you must still comply with the GPLv3 license;
            - If your project contains Undertale-related content (such as characters, music, or story), please refer to the previous section on derivative works.

            ---

            If you need further clarification on whether your project usage complies with the above licensing terms, feel free to add notes during development or directly contact me.

            We encourage creativity, advocate for fair use and sharing, and hope to assist more developers in realizing their ideas while respecting the spirit of open source and the copyright of the original creators.
