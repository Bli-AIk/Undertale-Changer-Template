## Background

###This project began in early 2022 and was completed solely by me (Bli_AIk).
###Prior to this, I had created a rudimentary Undertale fan battle template (unreleased) and used it to develop a game project.
###However, I was unsatisfied with the results of the old template. As a result, I aimed to create a template capable of producing a complete fan game.
###This marks the first step of the long journey for this project.

##

## Synopsis
###For now, the template includes the following contents:
###Title scene, rename scene,overworld scene,battle scene,gameover scene.
###Contains an external language pack system.
###You can use this template to create your own game or modify the original code. 
###However, please make sure to prominently display "Undertale-Changer-Template" in a visible location.
###Undetale Changer Template made by Bli_AIk.
###The project has used URP.

## Usage

1. Download and extract the files to a location of your choice, preferably in a path that is entirely in English.
2. Import the files into Unity.
3. Open the project in Unity, and you're good to go.

Currently compatible with Unity Editor version: 2022.3.3f1c1 LTS
I recommend using this version or a higher one for the best experience.
