## Background
This project began in early 2022 and was completed solely by me (Bli_AIk).

Prior to this, I had created a rudimentary Undertale fan battle template (unreleased) and used it to develop a game project.

However, I was unsatisfied with the results of the old template. As a result, I aimed to create a template capable of producing a complete fan game.

This marks the first step of the long journey for this project.

## Synopsis
### Undertale Changer Template made by Bli_AIk.

The project has used URP.

For now, the template includes the following contents:

Title scene, rename scene,overworld scene,battle scene,gameover scene.

Contains an external language pack system.

You can use this template to create your own game or modify the original code. 

However, please make sure to prominently display "Undertale-Changer-Template" in a visible location.


## Usage
1. Make sure you have purchased and played Undertale, you can click [here](https://undertale.com/) to purchase it.
2. Download and extract the files to a location of your choice, preferably in a path that is entirely in English.
3. Import the files into Unity.
4. Open the project in Unity, and you're good to go.

Currently compatible with Unity Editor version: 2021.3.15f1 LTS

I recommend using this version or a higher one for the best experience.

But it is not recommended to use the 2022 version, otherwise the template may have issues.
