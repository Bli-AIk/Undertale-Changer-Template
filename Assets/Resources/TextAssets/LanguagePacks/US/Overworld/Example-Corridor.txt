/* 
All dialogue texts for non-combat scenes.
The format is:
Speaker\Text;

<image=x> Set the display emotion code. Specifically, if x is a negative number, it means no one is speaking (narrator).
Emotion codes are generally predefined in the game. If you need to change them, you'll have to test them one by one.

Typewriter special characters (universal input):
<stop> This character will cause a brief pause when the typewriter reaches it.
(This character won't be displayed. It's generally used before/after punctuation marks. The principle is to use the preset "pause typing speed" to type an empty character, creating a pause.
In the old template, the typewriter would pause when it encountered punctuation marks, but this caused some specific issues. Therefore, it was changed to manually add this character.
Please note that pressing X won't pause at this character. This character can be stacked. The pause speed depends on the typewriter's settingsâ€”simply put, you can't change it.)

<enter> Enter key symbol.
<x> Directly input character x. x can only be a single character, and the typewriter will skip it and input directly.
<fx=x> Change the typewriter's sound effect to the x-th one.

If you need to input a long paragraph or simply want the player to press the Z key multiple times, you can insert <passText> within a paragraph of text.
When the typewriter detects this character, it will stop typing, and if the player presses the Z key, the current text will be cleared, and typing will resume.
Previous rich text formatting will be invalidated since the previous text has been cleared.

Rich text input examples:
<color=#00000000>Color code supports RGBA hexadecimal.
</color>Remove color.

<b>Bold text
</b>Remove bold.

<i>Italic text
</i>Remove italics.

<size=50>Change font size
</size>Remove size change.

<color=red>Color code supports specific names, see TMP documentation at http://digitalnativestudios.com/textmeshpro/docs/
</color>Remove color.
