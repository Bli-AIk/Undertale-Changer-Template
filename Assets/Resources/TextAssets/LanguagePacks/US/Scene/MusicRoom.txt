StrangerThings\Stranger Things;
StrangerThingsInfo\Music from pixabay.com, Used for DemoBattle.<enter>
No matter what, this track is really well-chosen.<enter>
It gives me the exact feeling I need — a dreamy vibe.;

FarAway\Far Away;
FarAwayInfo\Music from pixabay.com, Used for DemoBattle2.<enter>
I just want to find some sense of relaxation, just like what I felt after finishing the multi-battle refactor.;

TobyFox\Toby fox;

StartMenu\Start Menu;
StartMenuInfo\The music of the menu.<enter>
Simple and light, accompanied by a familiar melody.<enter>
A minimalist style — perhaps some will like it.;

AIk\AIk;

GoodNews\Good News;
GoodNewsInfo\The Game Over music for April Fools' Day.<enter>
I originally thought about using Spring Festival Overture, but to avoid copyright issues, I threw together my own track.<enter>
Just a quick MIDI edit, don’t ask. It’s just for fun.;

BitLove\BitLove;
BitLoveInfo\Music from the old template, once used for the settings page. Now available for anyone to use freely.<enter>
Written on June 15, 2021. Back when I still had the ability to compose music.<enter>
This is just my wishful thinking about the past.;

GoodNight\Good Night;
GoodNightInfo\Music for the menu page, though it shouldn't have been.<enter>
How many years have passed since this "Good Night"...<enter>
But isn't an ending just the beginning of something new?;

OnceUponATime\Once Upon a Time;
OnceUponATimeInfo\Music for story scenes.<enter>
Once upon a time, there was an idealistic fool,<enter>
who, driven by their own naive dreams,<enter>
turned and walked into the mountains.;

Ruins\Ruins;
RuinsInfo\Music for Ruins.<enter>
Piano pieces are always the best. They fit the atmosphere of Ruins perfectly.<enter>
If the world could only keep one instrument, I wish it would be the piano.<enter>
<enter>
...But I still replaced it. Why?<enter>
I don't remember.<enter>
<enter>
...Maybe people do change.;

Determination\Determination;
DeterminationInfo\Music for the Game Over scene.<enter>
After all these years, I had almost forgotten—<enter>
Was the theme of Undertale really "Determination"?;

Leave\Leave;
LeaveInfo\Music for the corridor scene.<enter>
This was a track Toby never implemented, yet it fits here surprisingly well.<enter>
Hearing it always brings me back to that time under URP Heresy’s guidance,<enter>
when I had just finished adjusting the 2D lighting in this corridor scene,<enter>
that bright morning... or evening... or late night... whatever.;

JustRuins\Just Ruins;
JustRuinsInfo\Music for Ruins... in UCT.<enter>
One day, on a whim, I thought, why not skip using the original track?<enter>
I grabbed a MIDI, threw in some random instruments, tweaked the tempo a bit, and called it a day.<enter>
And so, this thing was born.<enter>
<enter>
<enter>
Alright, I’ve completely lost my talent for composition.;

BitBone\BitBone;
BitBoneInfo\One of the debug tracks from the old template.<enter>
A few years ago, I made this just for fun, so naturally, I wasn’t too satisfied with it.<enter>
But now, listening to it, I actually think it sounds pretty good. Pretty good...<enter>
They say that when people look back on their past work, they find it laughable.<enter>
But for me—at least when it comes to my music—it’s the exact opposite.<enter>
<enter>
After all, I’ve already lost my creativity.
<enter>
<enter>
This track has nothing to do with skeletons besides the word "Bone" in its name.<enter>
That’s on me, my bad. I’ll be more careful next time.<enter>
Though this track was written quite a few years ago as well.;

BitCrazy\BitCrazy;
BitCrazyInfo\One of the debug tracks from the old template.<enter>
At the very least, I have a talent for going crazy.<enter>
