Battle UI texts.
Format as follows:

Turn\Turn number\Text;
Text that will always be displayed before a certain turn.
If Turn number is input as 0,
it will be randomly displayed before turns with no specific setting.

Act\Monster Name\Display Text\Text After Selection;
Mercy\Monster Name\Display Text\Text After Selection;
A monster can have up to four Act options, while Mercy can have three.
If the text is Null, it will be skipped.

Item-related options must be configured in the Item text section.

Special characters:
<getEnemiesName> get the name of the selected enemy
<getEnemiesATK> get the ATK of the selected enemy
<getEnemiesDEF> get the DEF of the selected enemy
The above three special characters are for use with Check and can only be used in ACT.

Typewriter special characters (universal input):
<stop> This character will cause a brief pause when the typewriter reaches it.
(This character won't be displayed. It's generally used before/after punctuation marks. The principle is to use the preset "pause typing speed" to type an empty character, creating a pause.
In the old template, the typewriter would pause when it encountered punctuation marks, but this caused some specific issues. Therefore, it was changed to manually add this character.
Please note that pressing X won't pause at this character. This character can be stacked. The pause speed depends on the typewriter's settings—simply put, you can't change it.)

<enter> Enter key symbol.
<x> Directly input character x. x can only be a single character, and the typewriter will skip it and input directly, which is very user-friendly.

</else> Display separator. If there are multiple display texts for an item, use this symbol to separate them.
-In general, each text has an equal probability of being displayed. (WIP, not finished, do not use)

If you need to input a long paragraph or simply want the player to press the Z key multiple times, you can insert <waitForUpdate> character within a paragraph of text.
When the typewriter detects this character, it will stop typing, and if the player presses the Z key, the current text will be cleared, and typing will resume.
Previous rich text formatting will be invalidated since the previous text has been cleared.

Rich text input example:
<color=#00000000>Color code supports RGBA hexadecimal.
</color>Remove color.

<b>Bold text
</b>Remove bold.

<i>Italic text
</i>Remove italics.

<size=50>Change font size
</size>Remove size change.

<color=red>Color code supports specific names, please search "rich text" or "Unity rich text" in your browser for details.
</color>Remove color
