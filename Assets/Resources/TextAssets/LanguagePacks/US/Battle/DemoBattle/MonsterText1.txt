/* Store character's single-turn dialogue messages
Format:
(sizeX, sizeY)\(offsetX, offsetY)\Give to Character\Bubble point to left or right, input a boolean value\Relative Y-coordinate of the arrow\Text;
The first bracket is the bubble size ratio, and the second is the relative offset coordinate. Give to Character, input the name for searching, false for pointing left, and true for pointing right. By default, press Z from top to bottom.
Some dialogue messages are implemented during battles and need to be written separately.
The relative Y-coordinate is used to adjust the arrow's position up/down. Please note that the center is -1.5.
The pivot point is the upper-left corner.
The bubble size ratio is generally not recommended to change (unless the text cannot fit), set it to (2,2) or higher to prevent it from being too small and causing pixel distortion.
