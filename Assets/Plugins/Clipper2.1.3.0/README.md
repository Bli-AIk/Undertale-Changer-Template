**Clipper2** is a major update of my original [**Clipper library**](https://sourceforge.net/projects/polyclipping/) which I'm now calling **Clipper1**. Clipper1 was written over 10 years ago and still works very well, but Clipper2 is better in just about every way.

 
### Example

      Paths64 subj = new Paths64();
      Paths64 clip = new Paths64();
      subj.Add(Clipper.MakePath(new int[] { 100, 50, 10, 79, 65, 2, 65, 98, 10, 21 }));
      clip.Add(Clipper.MakePath(new int[] { 98, 63, 4, 68, 77, 8, 52, 100, 19, 12 }));
      Paths64 solution = Clipper.Intersect(subj, clip, FillRule.NonZero);
