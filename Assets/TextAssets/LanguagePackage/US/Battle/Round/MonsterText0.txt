/*Save conversation messages in a single round.
Format:
(xxx,xxx)\(xxx,xxx)\Monster name\Boolean value with bubbles pointing left or right\Arrow relative y value\Text;
The first bracket is the bubble size scale, followed by the relative offset coordinate. Enter a name search for the role, false on the left and true on the right. The default is to press Z from top to bottom.

Some of the dialogue messages are implemented in the battle, and a single text is required.

The relative ordinate is used to adjust the arrow up/down. Notice that the center is - 1.5.

The pivot point is the upper left corner.

It is generally not recommended to change the bubble size ratio (unless the word size is too large). Set it above (2,2) to prevent pixel distortion caused by too small
