/*
UI text in battle.

The format is as follows:

Round\Round number\Text；

The text that must be displayed before a round.
If the number of rounds is 0
It will be displayed randomly before the round without specific settings.

Act\Monster name\Text displayed\Text displayed after selection;
Mercy\Monster name\Text displayed\Text displayed after selection;

A monster can have up to four Act options, while Mercy has three.
If the text is null, it will be skipped directly.

Item related options must be configured at the Item text.

Special characters:
</getEnemiesName>Get the name of the selected enemy
</getEnemiesATK>Get the ATK of the selected enemy
</getEnemiesDEF>Get the DEF of the selected enemy
The above three special characters are used for Check only for ACT.

Typewriter special characters (general) input:
</stop> or  龘 causes the typewriter to pause briefly as it passes through the character.
(This character will not be printed before/after the punctuation mark. The principle is to use the preset "pause typing speed" to type a blank character to achieve pause.

</enter>Use it to enter the carriage return symbol. 
<x> Enter the character x directly. X can only be one character. This character will skip the typewriter and be input directly. It is very easy to use.

</else>Display separator, if the food has more than one display text, use this symbol to split.

-In general, the probability of occurrence of each text display is equal. (WIP, please do not use)

If you need to input a long text or simply want the player to press the Z key more often, you can insert</passText>or 轂 into a text

After the typewriter detects the character, it will stop typing. If the player presses the Z key, it will clear the current text and continue typing.

The previous rich text will be invalidated because the previous text is empty.

Rich text input:
<color=#00000000>Color symbol, support RGBA, need hexadecimal
</color>Remove color

<b>bold
</b>Remove bold

<i>italic
</i>Remove italic

<size=50>Change font size
</size>Remove Changes

<color=red>Color symbol. If you need a specific support name, please search "Rich Text" or "Unity Rich Text" on your browser
</color>Remove color
