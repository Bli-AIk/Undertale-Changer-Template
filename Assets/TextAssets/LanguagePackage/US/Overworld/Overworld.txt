All dialogue texts of out of battle scenes.

Format:

Read name\Text;

<Image=x> or 鼵x鼵 set the expression code to be displayed. In particular, if x is negative here, it will be set as no one sends out a conversation (narration).

Generally speaking, the expression code is determined by the game. If you want to change it, you should test it one by on.

Typewriter special characters (general) input:
</stop> or  龘 causes the typewriter to pause briefly as it passes through the character.
(This character will not be printed before/after the punctuation mark. The principle is to use the preset "pause typing speed" to type a blank character to achieve pause.

</enter>Use it to enter the carriage return symbol. 
<x> Enter the character x directly. X can only be one character. This character will skip the typewriter and be input directly. It is very easy to use.

</else>Display separator, if the food has more than one display text, use this symbol to split.

-In general, the probability of occurrence of each text display is equal. (WIP, please do not use)

If you need to input a long text or simply want the player to press the Z key more often, you can insert</passText>or 轂 into a text

After the typewriter detects the character, it will stop typing. If the player presses the Z key, it will clear the current text and continue typing.

The previous rich text will be invalidated because the previous text is empty.
